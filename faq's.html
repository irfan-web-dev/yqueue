            <h4>What is YQueue?</h4>
            <p>
              We are more than an App! YQueue is a one-stop ordering & payment
              solution to tackle issues of time constraints, difficult
              recruitment and lack of customer loyalty. We allow customers to
              self-order & pay to reduce reliance on manpower, which translates
              to time saved and increased operational efficiency.

            <p>
              We are a merchant-centric platform that is constantly improving to
              cater to your business needs. We want to stimulate sustainable
              growth in the F&B industry via enhanced efficiency, less discounts
              and promos that dilute your brand's value.

              consumers: App, QR and Kiosk. Customers can order & pay through
              the YQueue App, scan QR codes to access your web-app or head
              directly to Kiosks deployed at your outlets to order instantly.

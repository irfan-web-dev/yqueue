            In just a short span of time, Hvala has achieved cult status as the
            ultimate matcha paradise. Not only are their matcha selections
            unparalleled, but their clean, minimalistic Japanese-inspired
            teahouse interior is just too #aesthetic for the millennial in us to
            resist.
          </p>

            Already with two locations in <b>111 Somerset</b> and
            <a href="#">CHIJMES</a>, Hvala tops themselves with a new
            three-storey shophouse along the streets of <b>Keong Saik</b>. This
            new outlet sports a rather non-descript storefront that belies its
            beautiful interior.
          </p>
          <div class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-3">
            <img src="new-in-town-blog-2.webp" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            You’ll find spacious seating on the second-floor with muted grey
            cushions and elegant wooden chairs. For a more zen afternoon, head
            over to the third floor for traditional tatami seating. No emails
            allowed here, sil vous plait.
          </p>
          <div class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-3">
            <img src="new-in-town-blog-3.webp" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Here, it’s not only matcha heaven but practically a utopia for those
            looking to lead a more vegan-friendly lifestyle. At this picturesque
            outlet, all of Hvala’s gelato flavours, cinnamon waffles and fudgy
            brownies are vegan friendly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spot a gelato flavour that’s made with
            <a href="#">the famous Oatly</a> oat milk. It is also the default
            milk option Hvala is introducing to their drinks at no extra charge.
            Of course, if you still have a hankering for fresh milk, Hvala
            offers that option too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Which is why I can’t wait to try Hvala’s new
            <b><i> Kinako Paste With Gelato (S$8.80)</i></b
            >, which features a warm roasted soybean paste served with said
            Oatly gelato.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just a note, their cakes are still made with eggs and dairy but
            Hvala’s chefs are working on it, so stay tuned.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the best parts of this new Hvala is the futuristic ordering
            system. All you have to do is place your orders with these kiosks
            and you’ll get the food delivered right to your table, seamless and
            fuss-free. Honey, this new Hvala outlet gets my vote.
          </p>

          <p>
            A gorgeous shophouse with quality matcha and vegan-friendly gelato?
            I see a perfect Sunday afternoon in my horizons very soon.
